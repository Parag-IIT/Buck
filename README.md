# STM32 + USB + Buck Converter PCB Design

Welcome to the STM32 + USB + Buck Converter PCB Design project! This repository contains all the files and documentation for designing a PCB using KiCad that integrates an STM32 microcontroller, a USB interface, and a buck converter.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to create a compact and efficient PCB that combines:
- **STM32 Microcontroller**: Provides robust processing power for a variety of applications.
- **USB Interface**: Enables seamless connectivity for data transfer and device programming.
- **Buck Converter**: Ensures efficient power management and stable performance.

## Applications

This PCB design can be used in various practical applications, including but not limited to:
- USB-Powered Devices
- Data Acquisition Systems
- IoT Gateways
- Smart Home Automation
- Robotics and Automation

## Repository Contents

- `schematics/`: Contains the KiCad schematic files.
- `pcb_layout/`: Contains the KiCad PCB layout files.
- `gerber_files/`: Contains the Gerber files for manufacturing the PCB.
- `bom/`: Bill of Materials listing all components used.
- `docs/`: Additional documentation, including design notes and application examples.
- `images/`: Rendered images of the PCB design.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To work with the files in this repository, you will need:
- [KiCad](https://kicad.org/) (version 6.0 or higher)

### Instructions

1. Open the project in KiCad:
   - Launch KiCad and open the project file located in the `schematics/` directory.
2. Review and modify the schematic:
   - Make any necessary adjustments to the schematic as per your requirements.
3. Generate the netlist:
   - Generate the netlist from the schematic to be used in the PCB layout.
4. Design the PCB layout:
   - Open the PCB layout file in the `pcb_layout/` directory and place the components, route traces, and ensure all design rules are met.
5. Generate Gerber files:
   - Once the PCB layout is complete, generate the Gerber files for manufacturing.

## Usage

### Programming and Debugging

The USB interface allows for easy programming and debugging of the STM32 microcontroller. Connect your development board to a computer via USB and use your preferred IDE (e.g., STM32CubeIDE) to upload and debug your firmware.

### Power Management

The buck converter efficiently steps down the input voltage to a suitable level for the STM32 and other components, ensuring stable and reliable operation.
